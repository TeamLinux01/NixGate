objects:
  # Optional: list of objects to track from labelmap.txt (default: shown below)
  track:
    - person
    - dog
    - cat
  # Optional: mask to prevent all object types from being detected in certain areas (default: no mask)
  # Checks based on the bottom center of the bounding box of the object.
  # NOTE: This mask is COMBINED with the object type specific mask below
  mask: 0,0,1000,0,1000,200,0,200
  # Optional: filters to reduce false positives for specific object types
  filters:
    person:
      # Optional: minimum width*height of the bounding box for the detected object (default: 0)
      min_area: 5000
      # Optional: maximum width*height of the bounding box for the detected object (default: 24000000)
      max_area: 100000

      # Optional: maximum width/height of the bounding box for the detected object (default: 24000000)
      max_ratio: 2.0
      # Optional: minimum score for the object to initiate tracking (default: shown below)
      min_score: 0.5
      # Optional: minimum decimal percentage for tracked object's computed score to be considered a true positive (default: shown below)
      threshold: 0.7
      # Optional: mask to prevent this object type from being detected in certain areas (default: no mask)
      # Checks based on the bottom center of the bounding box of the object
      mask: 0,0,1000,0,1000,200,0,200

# Optional: Motion configuration
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
motion:
  # Optional: The threshold passed to cv2.threshold to determine if a pixel is different enough to be counted as motion. (default: shown below)
  # Increasing this value will make motion detection less sensitive and decreasing it will make motion detection more sensitive.
  # The value should be between 1 and 255.
  threshold: 25
  # Optional: Minimum size in pixels in the resized motion image that counts as motion (default: 30)
  # Increasing this value will prevent smaller areas of motion from being detected. Decreasing will
  # make motion detection more sensitive to smaller moving objects.
  # As a rule of thumb:
  #  - 15 - high sensitivity
  #  - 30 - medium sensitivity
  #  - 50 - low sensitivity
  contour_area: 30
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging the motion delta across multiple frames (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the delta a lot, and a single raindrop may register as motion.
  # Too low and a fast moving person wont be detected as motion.
  delta_alpha: 0.2
  # Optional: Alpha value passed to cv2.accumulateWeighted when averaging frames to determine the background (default: shown below)
  # Higher values mean the current frame impacts the average a lot, and a new object will be averaged into the background faster.
  # Low values will cause things like moving shadows to be detected as motion for longer.
  # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/background-subtraction-in-an-image-using-concept-of-running-average/
  frame_alpha: 0.2
  # Optional: Height of the resized motion frame  (default: 50)
  # This operates as an efficient blur alternative. Higher values will result in more granular motion detection at the expense
  # of higher CPU usage. Lower values result in less CPU, but small changes may not register as motion.
  frame_height: 50
  # Optional: motion mask
  # NOTE: see docs for more detailed info on creating masks
  mask: 0,900,1080,900,1080,1920,0,1920
  # Optional: improve contrast (default: shown below)
  # Enables dynamic contrast improvement. This should help improve night detections at the cost of making motion detection more sensitive
  # for daytime.
  improve_contrast: False
  # Optional: Delay when updating camera motion through MQTT from ON -> OFF (default: shown below).
  mqtt_off_delay: 30

# Optional: Record configuration
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
record:
  # Optional: Enable recording (default: shown below)
  # WARNING: If recording is disabled in the config, turning it on via
  #          the UI or MQTT later will have no effect.
  enabled: True
  # Optional: Number of minutes to wait between cleanup runs (default: shown below)
  # This can be used to reduce the frequency of deleting recording segments from disk if you want to minimize i/o
  expire_interval: 60
  # Optional: Retention settings for recording
  retain:
    # Optional: Number of days to retain recordings regardless of events (default: shown below)
    # NOTE: This should be set to 0 and retention should be defined in events section below
    #       if you only want to retain recordings of events.
    days: 0
    # Optional: Mode for retention. Available options are: all, motion, and active_objects
    #   all - save all recording segments regardless of activity
    #   motion - save all recordings segments with any detected motion
    #   active_objects - save all recording segments with active/moving objects
    # NOTE: this mode only applies when the days setting above is greater than 0
    mode: motion
  # Optional: Event recording settings
  events:
    # Optional: Number of seconds before the event to include (default: shown below)
    pre_capture: 5
    # Optional: Number of seconds after the event to include (default: shown below)
    post_capture: 5
    # Optional: Objects to save recordings for. (default: all tracked objects)
    objects:
      - person
    # Optional: Restrict recordings to objects that entered any of the listed zones (default: no required zones)
    required_zones: []
    # Optional: Retention settings for recordings of events
    retain:
      # Required: Default retention days (default: shown below)
      default: 10
      # Optional: Mode for retention. (default: shown below)
      #   all - save all recording segments for events regardless of activity
      #   motion - save all recordings segments for events with any detected motion
      #   active_objects - save all recording segments for event with active/moving objects
      #
      # NOTE: If the retain mode for the camera is more restrictive than the mode configured
      #       here, the segments will already be gone by the time this mode is applied.
      #       For example, if the camera retain mode is "motion", the segments without motion are
      #       never stored, so setting the mode to "all" here won't bring them back.
      mode: motion
      # Optional: Per object retention days
      objects:
        person: 30

# Optional: Configuration for the jpg snapshots written to the clips directory for each event
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
snapshots:
  # Optional: Enable writing jpg snapshot to /media/frigate/clips (default: shown below)
  enabled: True
  # Optional: save a clean PNG copy of the snapshot image (default: shown below)
  retain:
    # Required: Default retention days (default: shown below)
    default: 30
    # Optional: Per object retention days
